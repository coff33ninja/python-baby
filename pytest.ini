markers =
    smoke: Marks tests as smoke tests (quick, basic functionality).
    slow: Marks tests as slow running (e.g., complex, I/O bound).
    unit: Marks tests as unit tests (testing individual components in isolation).
    integration: Marks tests as integration tests (testing interaction between components).
    # Add other custom markers as your project needs evolve
